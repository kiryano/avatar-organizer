# Avatar Organizer

## Introduction
This was created out of boredom to automate the organization of avatar files and organize them properly, since I have issues doing that.... üêà

## Features
- Moves avatar files containing the extensions of (e.g., JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF) into a folder named "avatars"
- Generates a random string for the filenames
- Error handling for cases such as existing "avatars" folder and no avatar files found
- Very easy to setup and use

## TODOs
- Implement logging for debugging & auditing purposes.
- Implement a check to verify the validity of the avatar files before moving them.
- Implement creating a backup or copy of each file in a separate directory before moving them.
- Implement a better way to organize files (e.g., sorting by date, size, etc.).
- Implement a recursive method to search for photo files in subdirectories.
- Make the script more interactive, with user prompts or command-line arguments.


## Usage
1. Place the script file in the directory containing the avatar files you want to organize.
2. Open up a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using the following command: `python avatar_organizer.py`
4. The script will create a folder named "avatars" (if it doesn't already exist lol) and move the photo files into it with a random generated string for the filenames.
5. Check the "avatars" folder to find your avatar files.

## Customization
- Supported file extensions: By default, the script supports the following extensions: JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF. You can customize the list of supported extensions by modifying the `avatar_extensions` variable in the script.
- Filename length: The random filenames generated are 10 characters long. If you want to change the length, you can modify the `k` parameter in the `random.choices` function in the script.


## Requirements

- Required Python Modules:
  - os
  - shutil
